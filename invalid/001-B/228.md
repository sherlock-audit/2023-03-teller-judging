# Malicious borrower can block liquidations causing the lender to receive neither the settlement amount nor the collateral

## Summary

 Once the loan has started the borrower can modify the [_bidCollaterals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L27) using the [commitCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117) function which causes that if the loan goes into default, the loan can not be liquidated and the lender can not receive neither the settlement amount nor the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

Once the loan has started the [commitCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117) is available to be called by anyone, allowing to modify the ```_bidCollaterals```. Then, if the loan goes into default, the [_withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L393) will be reverted by "Withdraw amount cannot be zero" error.

Please see the next attack scenario:

1. The loan has started.
2. The loan is defaulted and the malicious borrower calls [commitCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117) and put the collateral amount to [zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L434).
3. The liquidator wants to liquidate via [liquidateLoanFull()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L676) but is not possible because the function is reverted by "Withdraw amount cannot be zero" error.
4. The lender wants to grab the collateral via [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250) functions but is still not possible because the funcstion is reverted by "Withdraw amount cannot be zero" error.

## Impact

The malicious borrower can block the liquidations and the lender collateral withdrawals causing the lender to receive neither the settlement amount nor the collateral. Additionally the borrower can gain time to repay his loan.

I created a test where the malicious borrower deny the liquidations and the collateral withdrawals. Test steps:

1. Create the collateral bid and the lender accept it
2. Assert the escrow has the borrower's collateral
3. Malicious borrower modifies to zero the collateral amount via the [commitCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117) function
4. Skip the time so the loan is defaulted
5. The liquidations are reverted by "Withdraw amount cannot be zero" error
6. The collateral withdrawals are reverted by "Withdraw amount cannot be zero" error

## Code Snippet

The [commitCollateral()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117) allows anyone to modify the collateral available.

```solidity
File: CollateralManager.sol
117:     function commitCollateral(
118:         uint256 _bidId,
119:         Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
120:     ) public returns (bool validation_) {
121:         address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
122:         (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);
123: 
124:         if (validation_) {
125:             for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
126:                 Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
127:                 _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
128:             }
129:         }
130:     }
```

In the attack scenario, the collateral is set to zero causing the liquidations or collateral withdrawals transactions will be reverted by [amount zero error](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L89).

```solidity
File: CollateralEscrowV1.sol
84:     function withdraw(
85:         address _collateralAddress,
86:         uint256 _amount,
87:         address _recipient
88:     ) external virtual onlyOwner {
89:         require(_amount > 0, "Withdraw amount cannot be zero");
90:         Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
```

## Recommendation

Don't allow collateral modifications once the loan has started.
